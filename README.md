# Aquaponic's Firmware For Sonoff Dual R2

Firmware to control an aquaponics system using Sonoff Dual R2.  The Sonoff Dual R2 has two relays to control the pumps, the firmware acts as a timer to control the rely and provides a RestApi to control the pumps from OpenHab or HomeAssistant. The Sonoff curcuit board is removed from the orginal Sonoff enclosure and put into a weather proof enclosure ordered from Amazon.
